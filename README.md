## Description
This project allows users to input house features and get a predicted price instantly using a trained model.  
The model training file (`house_model.pkl`) and virtual environment are **not included** in the repository due to size limitations. Users can train the model locally if needed.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Pickle
- Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
